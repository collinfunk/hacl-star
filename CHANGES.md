- Removed for now removed features.
- Fixed for any bug fixes.
- Security in case of vulnerabilities.

## 2023-11-21

- Changed the API for more clarity and consistency. Heavy renaming of modules,
  functions and arguments as well as changes in the order of arguments. Blake2,
  MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, Poly1305 and EverCrypt are concerned. See
  https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star/pull/789 for a detailed list of the
  changes.

## 2023-05-22

- Change the return code of the Hacl_Streaming_XXX_update family of functions. These
  functions previously returned uint32_t, with 0 to indicating success, and 1
  indicating a maximum length exceeded error. These functions have now switched
  to an error code shared with other streaming API functions, of type
  uint8_t, wherein Hacl_Streaming_Types_Success indicates success, and
  Hacl_Streaming_Types_MaximumLengthExceeded conveys the same error as before.
  The Success case is defined as 0, meaning that clients that previously did
  `if (!Hacl_Streaming_XXX_update(...))` do not need any change in their code.
- Removal of Hacl_Streaming_SHA2.h -- all of the functions are now to be found
  in Hacl_Hash_SHA2.h, which brings SHA2 in alignment with other primitives.
- Renamings: Hacl_Hash_SHA2_hash_XXX becomes Hacl_Streaming_SHA2_hash_XXX
  (subject to change in the very near future, see #789)
- Renamings: Hacl_Streaming_SHA2_shaXXX becomes Hacl_Streaming_SHA2_hash_XXX
  (subject to change in the very near future, see #789)

## 2023-02-20

- Removed OCaml and JS bindings

## 2022-12-19

- Added JS bindings for secp256k1
- Added an OCaml API for secp256k1

## 2022-12-14

- Align the APIs in Hacl_Hash_SHA2 and Hacl_Streaming_SHA2 for full hashes. The
  latter now observes the argument order of the former.

## 2022-12-07

- Added secret_to_public for secp256k1

## 2022-12-06

- Tighten the `EverCrypt_Hash` header file to only expose the one-shot and
  "streaming" APIs.
